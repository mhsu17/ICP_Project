# ICP_Project
CIS II Project: Development of a Wearable Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Device
Our code involves complex SwiftUI structure powering our sign-in and login screens. There are no additional libraries needed to run the swift software. This app serves as telemonitoring app for ICP monitoring

Within our code we receive pressure reading from our sensor and output a readable graph for live data collection and display.
